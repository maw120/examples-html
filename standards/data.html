<a id="user-content-purpose" class="anchor" href="#purpose" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Purpose</h1>
<p>All users of Information Technology will interact with data while performing their jobs at the University of Akron. Generally, data will be considered Public, Sensitive, or Restricted and require certain procedures and standards for access and storage. It is the responsibility of the University of Akron to implement these procedures and standards to help users protect their data.</p>
<p>Certain statutes and regulations may require additional standards and procedures beyond the basic data handling guidelines for each classification. Examples of these statutes and regulations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>FERPA</li>
<li>HIPPA</li>
<li>PCI-DSS</li>
<li>Research involving CUI</li>
</ul>
<h1>
<a id="user-content-scope" class="anchor" href="#scope" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Scope</h1>
<p>This standard applies to all data collected, stored or processed by University staff or by third parties via contractual agreements with University departments or other organizational groups.</p>

<p>To assist in handling multiple forms of data, the University has defined three levels of data classification: Public, Sensitive, and Restricted. Each level of classification represents a specific set of technical and procedural security controls that will help reduce the risks of mishandled information.</p>
<p>Data that is not yet classified should be considered restricted until the data steward assigns an appropriate classification.</p>
<p>The classification of data is independent of its format. Video of interactions with patients in clinics would be considered HIPAA protected information. Paper copies of information that is considered restricted should be handled with appropriate protections.</p>
<p>If you have questions about the classification or handling of data should be directed to the appropriate data steward, supervisor, departmental security liaison, or the ITS security office. Departmental security liaisons, in coordination with the ITS security office, can assist departments in developing appropriate controls and processes to protect Sensitive or Restricted data.</p>

<td>Sensitive (High)</td>
<td>Sensitive data is the highest data classification category at the University of Akron. It is reserved for information that is either required by law or regulation to protect, or that the university has deemed critical to protect to reduce risk to the institution. Explicit approval from the data steward is needed to access, collect, modify, or change sensitive data. Additional protections beyond standard protections for sensitive data may be required by law or regulation.</td>

<li>Social Security Numbers</li>
<li>Credit Card Numbers</li>
<li>PHI (HIPAA protected data)</li>
<li>FERPA (Non-directory information)</li>

<li>Donor Data</li>
<li>CUI (Controlled unclassified information)</li>
<li>HR Data</li>
<li>Research data</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Restricted (Medium)</td>
<td>Restricted information is the default classification category. Restricted information is not intended for public consumption but does not fit into the sensitive category. Disclosure of restricted information would not significantly harm the university. Access to restricted data is determined by business process need.</td>
<td><ul>
<li>Anything not public or sensitive. </li>
<li>Data whose access is restricted to certain groups or departments on campus.</li>
<li>Other research data not considered sensitive or public.</li>
<li>Financial transactions</li>
<li>NDA data</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Public (Low)</td>
<td>Public data is data that is intended to be made available to the general public or is approved for publication.</td>
<td><ul>
<li>Public facing websites</li>
<li>Campus maps</li>
<li>FERPA directory data</li>
<li>Faculty/staff directory data</li>
